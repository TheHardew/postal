# Postal save-file editor
  
TheHardew.github.io/Postal-save-file-editor  
  
This project was created by Piotr "TheHardew" Syrokomski.  
Do whatever you'd like with it, just credit me.  

Before you read the code, please know, that I approached this project  
while having practically no html, css or pojs knowledge. I know this code is horrendous.  
Please do NOT learn from this.  
  
Thanks to:  
    -    Postal 1 developers (seriously, they're awesome)  
    -    Mika "Crumblingstatue" Attila for creating Flowey's Time Machine
